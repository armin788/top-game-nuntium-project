							Xbox Game So could be a game rental service. But for some reason this did not happen and the service was shared with the players.


GQ recently had an in-depth interview with Phil Spencer, Todd Howard and several other Xbox executives. Part of the interview talks about the days when Xbox Game was just an idea; A service that is now flourishing and is one of the cornerstones of Microsoft's gaming strategy. From this interview, we learn that Xbox has been developing gameplay since 2013, and this service was originally supposed to be similar to a service called Gamefly, which leases games.

							Introduction
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare is a first-person shooter video game developed by Infiniti Studios and released by Activision on October 25, 2019 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox.

This is the first version in the history of the Call of Duty series to take advantage of cross-platform capabilities. This game has nothing to do with the modern warfare trilogy and is actually a replay. In this game, the character of Captain Price is present.

Due to its strong anti-Russian stance and its attribution to the Russian military for collaborating with terrorist groups, its publication in the country has been criticized. This version of Call of Duty was acclaimed for its graphics, gameplay, story, and soundtrack.

According to the latest game news, Tom Henderson, a well-known insider, says that DICE Studio had come up with the idea of ​​making Star Wars: Battlefront 3 with EA, but Electronic Arts rejected it. He claims that the reason for the rejection is the high costs that EA has to pay to use the Star Wars license. Henderson quotes an unnamed Dice member as saying, "EA did not approve of its creation, because Star Wars Inc. Battlefront games have to sell 20 percent more than other EA games in order to generate similar revenue for the company."

							EA DICE Studios has released a new update to Battlefield 2042 for console and PC gamers to fix some major issues.


The Battlefield 2042 update is specifically designed to fix basic bugs and balance the overall gaming experience. One of the most important issues is fixing problems that prevented some users from having a consistent gameplay experience. Dice, for example, says there is no longer a problem with players being revived by their teammates. In addition, the new update focused specifically on vehicles and a number of game weapons to increase the balance of gameplay; From LCAA Hovercraft and MD540 Nightbird to KA-520 Super Hokum and AH-64GX Apache Warchief. In this update, an attempt has been made to make them more compatible with other items.

							A menu found among the GTA codes: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition indicates that this remaster is probably based on mobile versions of games.


Everyone else knows that Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition was made in the same studio that made GTA mobile ports. Now a YouTuber named Vadim M, according to an unused menu in the game files, says that GTA 3 remastered, GTA Vice City remastered and GTA San Andreas remastered are in fact modified versions of the same mobile ports of these Rockstar works.

In fact, he thinks that Grove Street Games Studio has prepared new versions based on the mobile versions made by him. Among the unused files, this person has found the menu to control the character with the touch screen. This is the same menu as the mobile version of the old GTA games, which only now has a relatively different font. We know that Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition will be released in 2022 as an iPhone game and Android game.
